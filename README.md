# b64

Swift UI macOS App for encoding and decoding base64 strings. That's it.

# Why?

There's no reason to build this app, I wanted to try learning SwiftUI and this ended up being the first project for that.

# Usage

- Download the `dmg` from the [releases](/releases)
- Mount and open `dmg`
- Copy to applications folder
- Attempt to open the app
- Go to System Preference > Security > General > Open
- You can now open the app.

# Roadmap

- [ ] Add an icon
- [ ] Add signing certificates (first get an apple developer account!)
